This Plugin allows your users to easily fill out your comment forms using an hCard.

== Description ==

This Plugin allows your visitors to easily fill out your comment forms using an hCard. I got this
Idea from SignUp pages like [bragster.com](https://www.bragster.com/signup) or 
[getsatisfaction.com](http://getsatisfaction.com/people/new).

hCard-Commenting now supports [representative hCards](http://microformats.org/wiki/representative-hcard)

== Installation ==

* Upload the `hcard-commenting` folder to your **plugin** folder

* It should work for the most themes (like K2 or Kubrik) without changes

* For all others, simply add `<?php hcard_commenting_link() ?>` where you want
the link to be displayed

Thats it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Microformats parser do you use? =

I use the [hKit](http://allinthehead.com/hkit/) parser from Drew McLellan and the hKit
service from [microformatic.com](http://tools.microformatic.com/help/xhtml/hkit/).

= Why do you also use the service =

hKit needs PHP5, if you run PHP4.3 you can't run the hKit parser natively.

= What are the next steps? =

hCard.photo as avatar, like hAvatar.
